# TransportationSQL
A Java GUI program where the user may input, filter or remove a passanger infromation which is then stored on a MySQL database. 

To delete a passanger, enter the id_number which is the primary key of the database.

The filter option will work to filter all the passanger's that will travel to the same final destination.

I've added the database table as well.

The ExtrasForTheCode are essentials libraries which you need to add for the code run perfectly. This code was made using the Eclipse IDE, so once you create your Java project an add all of the files of the code, on the Referenced Libraries you just drag an drop all the content from the folder. With that, you should be ready to run the program.
